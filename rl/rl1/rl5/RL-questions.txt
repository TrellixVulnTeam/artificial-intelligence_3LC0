what is the random seed generated?: the seed determines the
distribution of np.random() values for the q-values and when
generating r to compare with epsilon.

also, i get 24 points on assignment 5 and all i had to do was adjust alpha,
gamma and the threshold. in the lab spec they talk about keeping track of
highest return R, annealing alpha etc etc but i didnt have to do any of that.
 to get an A, how deep does my knowledge actually need to be?:
 you are supposed to do more than just that apparently,
 so post this on canvas...
